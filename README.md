# ADC-Net (EAAI-25-684) 
PyTorch implementation of **An Unsupervised Anatomy-aware Dual-constraint Cascade Network for Lung Computed Tomography Deformable Image Registration**

## Introduction
In this study, we propose an unsupervised Anatomy-aware Dual-constraint Cascade network called ADC-Net. An efficient single-level network based on an FCN is developed, incorporating a tri-directional deformation capture (TDC) block designed to calculate voxel correlations along three spatial dimensions separately, thereby comprehensively capturing lung deformations in different directions, particularly large deformations along the lungâ€™s vertical axis. A low-computational-cost upsampling structure is adopted by the single-level network to ensure the efficiency and rapid performance of ADC-Net. To further improve the awareness of large deformations as well as internal anatomical details, we propose a dual-constraint cascade mode. In this mode, contour-enhanced and vessel-enhanced images used as constraints, along with the original images, are fed into three single-level networks, which achieves accurate registration of large deformations while ensuring precise alignment of internal details. ADC-Net was trained on three public lung CT datasets, SPARE, Creatis, and COPD, and tested on the Dir-lab and ThoraxCBCT datasets. Comparative experiments with several state-of-the-art methods thoroughly validate the performance of ADC-Net in the DIR of lung CT.
